# CS-255--System-Analysis-and-Design


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The client was DriverPass. They are an online database that enables individuals to take online practice tests and behind the wheel practice before going into the DMV to take their drivers license exam. The system needs to update automatically in order to stay up to date on the current rules and regulations that the DMV upholds. 

What did you do particularly well?

  I believe I did the client presentation well. This portion of the project was to create a presentation that enabled people with no technical background to follow along with the system design. To do so we were prohibited to use any technical jargon that might confuse the audience. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  If I were to improve part of a document,  I would choose the UML Class diagram. I would choose this because I did not really add too many methods to the diagram to show each class proficiently. Therefore, the revision would include that diagram which would allow a more visual representation of the system

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  The user needs were interpreted via an interview between the owner of the DriverPass company, their IT lead, and some representatives from our company. The needs are interpreted by defining and understanding the clients needs and distinguishing them from the wants. This will ensure that the requirements from the client are met to the fullest. It is very important to consider the users needs when designing systems because if you do not, then it can cause a lot of re-work and cost the company more money in order to go back and implement the clients needs. This will also cause the company to need more time to get the correct 


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I would try to acquire all of the business requirements set by the client, and if there were any questions of any nature, I would get back in contact with the client in order to not make any assumptions when designing the system. If this is not done, it can cause a lot of re-work to be done as well as the companies money and time lost. I would also try to set up frequent appointments in order to show the client that we are being as transparent as possible while designing and programming their system. A certain technique that I would use would be called the JAD Technique. This is where you would schedule for a meeting that might last a couple days in length in order to come to terms with the requirements that are needed for the system to be built efficiently.
